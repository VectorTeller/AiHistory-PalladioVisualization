# An Interactive Visualization of AI History

This project explores the history of Artificial Intelligence from its conceptual beginnings to the modern era of generative models. The data was compiled and visualized using Palladio to show the key institutions behind major breakthroughs, where these events happened, and how progress unfolded over time.
